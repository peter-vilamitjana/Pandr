# Pandr

Welcome to **Pandr**, a modern developer-focused IDE built with performance, clarity, and elegance in mind. This project was created as part of a hands-on deliverable using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), a no-code/low-code visual builder for modern apps.

This project was developed as a technical challenge to showcase my design expertise, the integration of visual components, React interactivity, and modern UX/UI principles. Initially created as a prototype on Lovable, I then took the project further by refining and enhancing the design locally in Visual Studio Code, focusing on improving both the visual structure and the dynamic interactions of the site.
